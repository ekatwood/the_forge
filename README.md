Artist-driven quest items, 3D modeled for you!

## Overview

Built with Flutter and the Avalanche9000 blockchain, this will be a custom L1 blockchain called TheForge $FORGE, with a dapp that goes with it.

Users will be able to upload their own artwork, and the back end of the dapp will 3D model it for them, turning it into a unique NFT quest item.

People will be able to buy the resulting NFT quest item using $FORGE tokens. There are many video games being built using Avalanche9000, and these unique 3D NFT quest items will be interoperable across all other L1s in the Avalanche9000 ecosystem. So, they could be used in any game they are compatible with.
